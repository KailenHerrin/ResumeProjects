To run assignment: python RayTracer.py <testcase name>.txt

Because it's in python it takes a while to run the program,
however on my computer no 400x400 file took much longer than a minute so I'm hoping this is ok.

What works:
The hit detection and drawing of spheres works
The diffuse and ambient colors work fine
Shadows work fine

What doesn't work:
For this assignment I couldn't get the specular or the reflection colors to work properly, they show up but in the wrong spots.
